Qwiic UV Sensor - ZOPT2201
========================================

[*SPX-14264*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14264)

The ZOPT2201 is an excellent UVBS (ultraviolet energy sensor) in that it does true 310nm UVB sensing, not interpolated UV from ambient light like most sensors on the market. Without fuss or weird look up tables this sensor gives the current UV Index accurately.

The [Qwiic system](http://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic) enables fast and solderless connection between popular platforms and various sensors and actuators. You can read more about the Qwiic system [here](http://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic).

This product is _**open source**_!

Please review the LICENSE.md file for license information...but SF accidentally forgot to include that. I defer to them on whatever the license "should" be; I normally just slap GPLv2 on stuff but don't want to crimp their style if they need to commercialize it (I am building on their work after all).

Distributed as-is; no warranty is given.

_<COLLABORATION CREDIT>_

This library is built on @nseidle's excellent example code, available [here](https://github.com/sparkfunX/Qwiic_UV_Sensor-ZOPT220x). I just wanted a library I could drop in my existing UV sensor testing code.
